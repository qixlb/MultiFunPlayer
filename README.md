ugly mashup of 
https://github.com/Yoooi0/MultiFunPlayer and https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer
all credits to them
created an additional output that connects to mk312 estim device and and maps
L0 = Intensity channel A
L1 = Frequency channel A
L2 = Width channel A
R0 = Intensity channel A
R1 = Frequency channel A
R2 = Width channel A

this is a VERY DRAFT FORK and I will hardly dedicate on it.

I had to edit mk312 library to keep connection stable when serial connections drops, did not figure out why...

peace
